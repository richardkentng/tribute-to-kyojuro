        <h2>Who was Kyojuro?</h2>
        <p>
          Kyojuro Rengoku was a hashira - an elite member of the Demon Slayer
          Corps. Yes, you heard that correctly. His life's purpose was to
          eradicate the flesh-eating demons that live alongside us, taking the
          appearance of humans. The reason you can sleep safely at night is
          because demon slayers like Kyojuro are out there slicing demons into
          confetti.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Kyojuro wasn't just any demon slayer. He was a hashira - a
          rank only the most skilled demon slayers can achieve. (We're talking
          only 0.000001% of demon slayers can become hashiras, since most demon
          slayers unwillingly become demon munch early on in their career.)
          Kyojuro learned from an early age that his life's purpose was to
          protect those who couldn't defend themselves.
        </p>
        <h2>A Larger Than Life Personality</h2>
        <p>
          When Kyojuro wasn't fighting demons, he was a joy to be around. If you
          spoke to him, he would respond by shouting back at you with great
          ethusiasm. If you cooked him a meal he would gulp it down in two
          seconds. If you asked him to teach you sword skills he would proudly
          declare himself your teacher. And if a demon attacked you, he would
          summon all might to vanquish such evil.
        </p>
        <h2>His Role Aboard the Mugen Train</h2>
        <p>
          As a hashira, Kyojuro would often receive missions to eradicate demons
          at various locations. His last mission was to slay demons reportedly
          lurking aboard the Mugen train. The odds were stacked against Kyojuro;
          a powerful demon had it's grasp over the entire train, and could
          produce tentacles from any location to devour unsuspecting passengers.
          But Kyojuro wasn't having it. With the help of some other demon
          slayers, Kyojuro managed to protect every passenger from the
          tentacle-demon until it was finally slain.
        </p>
        <h2>His Final Battle</h2>
        <p>
          Kyojuro could turn just about any demon he encountered to mere ashes
          within a fraction of second. But on one particular day, he had the
          misfortune to encounter an entirely different kind of demon - an upper
          moon. Just like hashiras are the most skilled demon slayers, upper
          moons are the most deadly demons. If upper moons are injured, they can
          regenerate their wounds, such as severed limbs, in the blink of an
          eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when Kyojuro met an upper moon #3, Akaza, on a dark night, he knew
          he had to fight with everything he had. And fight he did. He unleased
          his full fury upon Akaza, attacking him with different sword
          techniques that would have demolished any lesser demon. As the fight
          dragged on, Kyojuro grew tired. His left eye had been crushed. Several
          of his ribs were shattered. Meanwhile, being the demon that he was,
          all of Akaza's wounds had healed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just when it seemed like Kyojuro would topple over from exhaustion, he
          gritted his teeth and sprinted toward Akaza in a fiery blaze, in one
          last attempt to destroy him. Akaza met Kyojuro head on. Akaza
          deflected the sword strike that would have taken his head, and then
          drove his fist into Kyojuro's gut. Kyojuro spit out blood. Surely,
          this was the end for him?
        </p>

        <p>
          But Kyojuro wasn't done yet. So long as he was conscious, he would
          keep fighting, regardless of whether his internal organs were busted
          or not. This being the case, he shouted defiantly and drove his sword
          partly into Akaza's neck. Akaza tried to punch Kyojuro with his free
          hand but Kyojuro, amazingly, stopped it with his own free hand. Akaza
          was shocked. How could a human have so much strength, be so firm and
          resolute, even on the brink of death?
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, they wrestled, each trying to kill the other in a desperate
          struggle. But Akaza had another huge worry on his mind. The night was
          coming to an end, and the sun was starting to rise. If the sunlight
          touched him, then he would burn to dust. Besides demon slayers, the
          sunlight was the worst fear of all demons, regardless of whether they
          werre upper moons or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, suddenly, the struggle was over. In order to escape Kyojuro's
          grasp, Akaza broke his own arms, before escaping into the darkness of
          a nearby forest. Kyojuro wasn't so lucky. His stomach had been
          punctured through. He was bleeding badly. There was no hope. In a
          matter of seconds, he would die. And yet, he had accomplished his
          mission. He had protected the innocent. Nobody nearby had died from
          Akaza. Kyojuro had died a hero.
        </p>

        <h2>Kyojuro's Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Kyojuro may be gone, but what he stood for will never be forgotten:
          Bravery, grit, and selflessness. The people that Kyojuro protected
          will never forget the price he paid for their freedom, nor will they
          forget the evil monster that took his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that anybody who is feeling devasted by Kyojuro's loss
          should NOT attempt to hunt down Akaza in a blind rage. He is extremely
          dangerous. Only hashiras or other demon slayers equipped with copious
          amounts of plot armor should even consider crossing paths with an
          upper moon demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, any readers wanting to take action should embody Kyojuro's
          values. That is, to tackle any righteous obstacle with your utmost
          strength, and to offer a helping hand to those who need it dearly. May
          Kyojuro's spirit live on!
